        <h3>Some of his biggest legacy:</h3>
        <!-- List -->
        <ul>
          <li>Throughout his career, Cruyff became synonymous with the playing style of "Total Football".</li>
          <li>Cruyff always considered the aesthetic and moral aspects of the game; it was not just about winning, but about winning with the "right" style and in the "right" way.</li>
          <li>Cruyff is widely seen as a revolutionary figure in the history of Ajax, Barcelona, and the Netherlands.</li>
          <li>The style of play Cruyff introduced at Barcelona later came to be known as <i>tiki-taka</i> and <i>positional play</i> — characterised by short passing and movement, working the ball through various channels, and maintaining possession.</li>
          <li>This style of play went on to influence the world of football today, with most of the teams apply many characteristics into their gameplan.</li>
          <li>The biggest managers that are influenced by <i>positional play</i> include Pep Guardiola, Nagelsmann, Xabi Alonso, Xavi Hernandez, Mikel Arteta, etc.</li>
